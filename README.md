# TurtleMaze

A 2D game in which the player plays as a turtle that is trapped in a maze and wants to escape. However, as time passes, its life reduces and in order to prevent that, the player would need to collect pick-ups while trying to find a way out.

This game was part of my university intake assignment, developed in GameMaker game engine.
